## Quick Start

### For APC Smart-UPS with Network Card (NMC2)
```yaml
devices:
  - name: smart_ups
    driver: snmp-ups
    port: 192.168.1.50  # NMC2 IP
    config:
      - community = "private"
      - snmp_version = "v1"
```

### For APC PDU (AP7900B)
```yaml
devices:
  - name: rack_pdu
    driver: powerman
    port: "powerman://localhost:10101"
    powerman_device: "ap7900b"

powerman:
  enabled: true
  devices:
    - name: ap7900b
      type: apc
      host: 192.168.1.75  # PDU IP
      username: apc
      password: yourpass
      nodes: "outlet[1-8]"
```

## Using These Examples

1. **Choose the appropriate example** for your hardware
2. **Copy the configuration** to your addon settings
3. **Modify critical values**:
   - IP addresses for your devices
   - Usernames and passwords (NEVER use defaults!)
   - SNMP community strings
   - Device-specific settings
4. **Save and restart** the addon
5. **Check logs** for any configuration errors
6. **Add to Home Assistant** via the NUT integration

## Important Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **ALWAYS** change default passwords on all devices
üîí Use SNMPv3 instead of v1/v2c when possible
üåê Isolate management interfaces on a separate VLAN
üîê Enable HTTPS/SSH and disable telnet when possible
üìù Keep firmware updated on all devices

## Device Compatibility

These examples should work with:
- **APC Smart-UPS**: SMT, SMX, SRT series with NMC2/NMC3
- **APC PDUs**: AP7900 series, AP8959, AP8961
- **Other SNMP UPS**: Most network-enabled UPS with SNMP support
- **Other PDUs**: IPMI-based PDUs, Baytech, Raritan (with PowerMan)

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:
- **Connection refused**: Check network connectivity and firewall rules
- **Authentication failed**: Verify credentials and SNMP community strings
- **No data**: Ensure correct driver and port configuration
- **Missing sensors**: Some features depend on device firmware version
